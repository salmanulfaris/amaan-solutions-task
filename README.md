### Task Overview

```markdown
You will build a simple order management system where users can:
âœ… Register and log in (Sanctum authentication).
âœ… Create, update, and delete orders.
âœ… Fetch real-time exchange rates from an external API.
âœ… Implement global logging for important actions.

Authentication

Use Laravel Sanctum for API authentication.
Orders API

Implement CRUD operations for orders.
An order should have: id, user_id, product_name, amount, and status.
Ensure only the creator of an order can update or delete it.

Global Logging

Log every order action (create, update, delete) in a custom action_logs table.
Each log should store the user ID, action type, and timestamp.
Bonus (If You Want to Impress Us) ðŸš€

Implement caching for API responses.
Use event listeners for logging instead of directly writing in controllers.
Add unit tests for the order module.
